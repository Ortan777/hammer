ðŸ§  AI Usage Explanation
When a user submits a goal (e.g., "I want to improve my fitness"), the backend sends a prompt to OpenRouterâ€™s Mistral model via the /api/plan route. The model returns a 7-day plan in JSON format:
{
  "plan": [
    { "day": 1, "task": "Do 15 minutes of yoga", "tip": "Start slow and be consistent." },
    ...
  ]
}
This plan is rendered on the frontend, allowing users to check off completed days and track their journey.
