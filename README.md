## 🤖 How AI is Used

The app uses OpenRouter's AI API with the `mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct` model to generate a personalized 7-day plan based on the user's goal. The user inputs a goal, and the backend fetches an AI-crafted plan, structured as JSON, which the frontend displays and tracks progress on.

Example prompt:
```
"Create a 7-day plan for: 'Start meditating daily'. Return valid JSON with: { plan: [ { day: 1, task: "...", tip: "..." }, ... ] }"
```
